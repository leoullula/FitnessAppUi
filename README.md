# fitness_app

A new Flutter project.

## Getting Started
 It is a fitness App Having Animations such as radal progress and Graph bar 
 It is from the youtube channel Techie Blossom.I learnt it from there

This project shows a Radial Progress and a Animated Graph Bar seperately
to see the graph bar change the line 10 in main .dart replace MyApp() to ShowGraph() and to see the fitness app home page do vice versa.
